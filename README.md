## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Instagram
- We can edit messages
- Change your profile pictures
- We can unsend messages
Snapchat
- We know when others have read your messages
- can send streaks to others
- can change your bitmoji
Spotify
- Can create playlist
- Can create shared playlist with your friends
- Spotify creates playlist for you based on what listen the most

If I could improve the Spotify App I would create a feature that would allow you to see your playing history, even if you changed your playlist you could still see your unscary played history, because currently on sporty you are not allowed to see what you played before unless you click the previous button, and that does not always work because when you change playlist it resets your previous button and only shows the previous from the song played from this playlist. so I would create a feature that would allow you to see every song you played before without having to click the previous button and play the song before. Next, I would also create a feature that allows user to customer their main page whether it's changing the background color or be able to add images, or being able to change the layouts of their page and select with shortcuts they want on their page and how many shortcuts you want, whether its one that goes directly to one of your specific playlists wihtotu having to search for it or adding one for you favorite artist. 

## Notes

I havent faced many major changes challenges, just small complication such as finding how I could open the storyboard file. However I was able to use the Slack support channel to guide me.
